# Sniper-O-Mancer

I will create a whitepaper soon for this repository, but for now heres the basics:

Bot scans every 5 seconds by default for new contracts on JewArch. Once the new contract has been added to the database, it will be monitored for any activity and possible entries.

Includes several helpers and rug detectors to help out.

Adjust settings and run.
